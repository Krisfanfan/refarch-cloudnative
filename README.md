# Digital Applications using a Microservice Architecture

## Architecture

This project provides is a Reference Implementation for building a cloud-native OmniChannel Application using a Microservices architecture.  The Logical Architecture for this reference implementation is shown in the picture below.  

   ![Application Architecture](static/imgs/app_architecture.png?raw=true)

## Application Overview

The application is a simple store front shopping application that displays a catalog of antique computing devices, where users can buy and add review comments.  It has Web and Mobile interface, both the Mobile App and Web App rely on separate BFF (Backend for Frontend) services to interact with the backend data.  

There are several components of this architecture.  

- This OmniChannel application contains both a [Native iOS Application](https://developer.apple.com/library/content/referencelibrary/GettingStarted/DevelopiOSAppsSwift/) and an [AngularJS](https://angularjs.org/) based web application.  The diagram depicts them as a Device and Browser.  
- The iOS application uses the [IBM Mobile Analytics Service](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/mobile-analytics/) to collect device analytics for operations and business
- Both Client Applications (or via BFF) make API calls through an API Gateway.  The API Gateway is [API Connect](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/api-connect/).  API Connect provides an OAuth Provider as well, allowing you to implement API Security.  
- The Web and Mobile app invoke their own backend Microservices to fetch data, we call this component BFFs following the [Backend for Frontends](http://samnewman.io/patterns/architectural/bff/) pattern.  In this Layer, front end developers usually write backend logic for their front end.  The Web BFF is implemented using the Node.js Express Framework.  The Mobile iOS BFF is implemented using Server side [Swift](https://www.ibm.com/cloud-computing/bluemix/swift).  These Microservices run in Bluemix as Cloud Foundry Applications.  
- These BFFs invoke another layer of reusable Java Microservices.  In a real world project, this is sometimes written by a different team.  These reusable microservices are written in Java using [SpringBoot](http://projects.spring.io/spring-boot/).  They run inside [IBM Containers](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/images) using [Docker](https://www.docker.com/).
- The SocialReview microservices is implemented with Serverless technologies on [Bluemix OpenWhisk](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/openwhisk/). It exposes itself as consumable REST API via API gateway mentioned above.  
- BFFs, OpneWhisk and Java Microservices communicate to each other using the [Netflix OSS Framework](https://netflix.github.io/).  In this case, we run several Netflix components in Bluemix.
    - [Zuul](https://github.com/Netflix/zuul) provides a proxy layer for the microservices.  
    - [Eureka](https://github.com/Netflix/eureka) provides a Service Registry.  The reusable Java Microservices register themselves to Eureka which allows clients to find them.
    - [Hystrix](https://github.com/Netflix/hystrix) Provides an implementation of the [Circuit Breaker Pattern](http://martinfowler.com/bliki/CircuitBreaker.html).  This component runs as library inside the Java Applications.  This component them forward Service Availability information to the Hystrix Dashboard.  
- The Java Microservices retrieve their data from databases.  The Catalog service retrieves items from a searchable JSON datasource using [ElasticSearch](https://www.elastic.co/). The Inventory Service using [MySQL](https://www.mysql.com/).  In this example, we run MySQL in a Docker Container for Development (In a production environment, it runs on our Infrastructure as a Service layer, [Bluemix Infrastructure](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/?category=infrastructure))  The resiliency and DevOps section will explain that.  The SocialReview Microservice relies on [Cloudant](https://new-console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/services/cloudant-nosql-db/) as its Database. The application also relies on [Bluemix Object Storage](https://console.ng.bluemix.net/catalog/object-storage/) to store unstructured data such as images.
